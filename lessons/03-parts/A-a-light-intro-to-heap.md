### Hopefully you "understand" rust now
The selling point of rust should become more clear now.  Why people _love_ it.
`Option`, `Result`, and `Iterator`s are a foundation of the items you work with
and allow for highly optimized code with great readability

<br />

But there is one more concept that we need to go over.  The Borrow Checker.
This is the item that everyone always talks about when it comes to Rust and
difficulty.  I would argue its not that difficult.  What you just got done
learning is more difficult.

### But first
These next parts are teaching you some of the rust fundamentals that just don't
have a typescript side by side.  To be able to use rust effectively, we need to
cover these

### Stack vs Heap?
You have probably heard this term throughout your career.  It may confuse you
what they are.  To understand rust, it is required you have a very simple
understanding of the stack

(write a bit of code, vec, struct, stack overflow)

(whiteboard time!)

(don't forget to mention returing my_foo)

(don't forget to mention Option)

(for every heap allocation, there is a stack allocation)
